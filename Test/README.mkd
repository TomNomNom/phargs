# Test dir

Tests are awesome. I've split my tests up into three suites.

## Unit
Tests that test exactly one class and no more. 

## Integration
Tests that test the interaction between one or more classes.

## FullStack
Tests that actually launch a PHP process that uses Phargs and check the output.
